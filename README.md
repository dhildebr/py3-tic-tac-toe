# Python Tic-Tac-Toe

This repository holds my first project from Jose Portilla's "Complete Python Bootcamp" on Udemy &ndash; it is a tic-tac-toe game played from the console. While I could probably figure out how to use classes, for the sake of the course I've committed the grave sin of using global variables. Edsger Dijkstra is presumably rolling in his grave right now.

## How to Play

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed, e.g. via Anaconda.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Wherever you have this repository saved, run `python tic-tac-toe.py` on your console of choice.
